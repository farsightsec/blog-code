# dnsqr_filter
A reusable example of an [`nmsg`](https://github.com/farsightsec/nmsg) filter
using [`wdns`](https://github.com/farsightsec/wdns) to filter interesting
DNS traffic out of a passive DNS stream. Originally published in
[Processing Passive DNS With the nmsg C API](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/processing-passive-dns-with-the-nmsg-c-api/).

The filter included in `edns_filter.c` looks for non-`EDNS0` responses
to `EDNS0` queries, which indicates an authoritative server not complying
with `EDNS0`.

New filters can be added by defining a function matching:
```C
	int dnsqr_filter(nmsg_message_t);
```
in a new file `your_filter.c`, and specifying rules to make
`dnsqr_your_filter` in `Makefile`. If `dnsqr_filter(m)` returns
nonzero, `m` is copied to the output file or socket given on
the `dnsqr_your_filter` command line.

## dnsqr_filter example

    $ ./dnsqr_edns_filter -h
    Usage: ./dnsqr_edns_filter
    [-h]        Display help text
    [-r file]   Read nmsg data from file
    [-l ip/port]    Read nmsg data datagram socket
    [-C channel]    Read nmsg data from channel
    [-w file]   Write nmsg data to file
    [-s ip/port]    Write nmsg data to datagram socket

    $ ./dnsqr_edns_filter -C ch202 -w edns0_fail.nmsg
    ^C

    $ nmsgtool -r edns0_fail.nmsg -c 1
